# OccuTher
An occupational therapy app for kids: this hackathon project uses Unity, Vuforia, C#, and XCode to create an augmented reality app. Kids can practice isolating finger motion by ‘pressing’ a virtual button with the iPhone camera opened on a trackable image, causing additional virtual butterflies to appear on screen.

# Expansion
Currently, there is only one image target for exercises. Ideally, there would be a user interface to select from a number of different exercises and that there would be tracking for 3D objects/shapes (e.g. hand positions).
