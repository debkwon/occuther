# OccuTher
An occupational therapy app for kids. Uses Vuforia's package for Unity and deployed via Xcode.

# Expansion
Currently, there is only one image target for exercises. Ideally, there would be a user interface to select from a number of different exercises and that there would be tracking for 3D objects/shapes (e.g. hand positions).
